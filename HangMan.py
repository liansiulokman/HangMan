"""
Documentation:

In this implementation, player needs to enter an alphabets or a word with
alphabets in every guess input. Besides, all text inputs required are
numbers or 'yes' and 'no'. 

After reading the game rules, player can start a new game by choosing a 
game level. 3 levels are available, Beginner, Medium, and Expert. There
are approximately a total of 360 words provided, with 120 words for each 
level. The program will randomly choose a word from the 120 words after 
player had chose a game level.

With the randomly chosen word, the game begins with asking player to enter
his or her first guess. All guesses can be either an alphabet or a word 
which must be alphabets only. Other inputs including empty inputs, spaces, 
numbers, or other symbols will be rejected.

If the input for guess is valid, the program will perform algorithms to check
that guess is correct or wrong. A result message will be shown after each 
guess no matter it is correct or wrong. 

Player can make guesses continuously until 7 wrong guesses are made, i.e. the
whole hang man is drawn and displayed. The hang man will be displayed only 
when wrong guesses are made. Player needs to close the hang man window before
entering next guess. 

During the game, player can choose to quit anttime by enterintg the word "quit"
as guess. If player choose to quit, the game will not be saved and player needs
to start a new game if he or she chose to quit. Confirmation is needed to quit
the game program. If player do not want to quit, he or she can choose to go 
back to the game menu to start another game.

Player inputs are validate by the 2 input validation functions, which are 
designed for the two main types of inputs in this implementation, numbers and
alphabets. Error message will be displayed when user inputs are in valid.

There are 9 coordinate system functions, including functions for handling 
the quit game function, some confirmation functions and some functions before 
starting the game, like demo display, rule display, choosing game level, etc.

With these functions, there may be more potential bugs but it also generates
more possibilities for the game, which can personalize this common game. 

For the 8 game logic functions, they are more complicated and contains more 
calculations as there are too many possibilities to predict and too many 
assumptions need to made to prevent from bugs. Therefore, many variables with
True/False values are set to avoid errors in the complicated calculations.

The 4 display functions are mainly done by graphics and the built-in functions 
of strings and lists. There are almost no GUI components as the hang man game
need not to be that fancy and complicated according to my childhood memory. 
Therefore, the style of this game is very simple as you can see, just a
graphic window and others are all text and text.

Here are some statistics for reference, there are total of 13 for-loops, 64 if
or elif-statements, more than 10 variables, 23 working functions, few list, 
strings, boolean operator. Besides os, I have imported 3 non nuilt-in modules,
including random (for choosing words), graphics (for hang man display), and
time (for program sleep). Also, one of the math operation is used for getting
and calculating mouse click position in the hang man display function. Files
(for rules display and choose word from the 3 word libraries) are read in rules
function and chooseWord function.

There are only three lines of codes in the test() as the program is designed 
with deep linkings between functions. Every functions links each other and bugs
are already removed and hopefully its number is already minimized.

I believed the explanations commented are clearly stated and understandable.
Hope you enjoy the game!
