1. Try to guess a vocabulary word that is randomly chosen by computer

2. Each guess should be either an alphabet or a word

3. Repeated guesses are not allowed

4. The hang man will be marked and displayed when your guess is wrong

5. Try to guess the word correctly before the whole hang man is marked

Good Luck!
